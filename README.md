# BlogServices

## Info 
#### This application implements basic functions for blog site - CRUD operations. Tested with Postman agent for operations GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. I have developed it in ASP.NET Web API, standard .NET Framework 4.7.2 and EntityFramework 6. Database is not attached becouse approach is code first. In BlogContext class database is called "BlogDatabase", with one migration that will seed some data in databse for testing first without POST request. Database will create on default instance of SQL Server, in my case it is LocalDB. 

## Instruction for using
#### When clone project, first need to install some nuget packages that package manager will automaticly detect, then run command update-databse. This will create database "BlogDatabase" and seed some blog posts and tags. After that api is ready for usage. 
### GET api/posts
#### Return all posts ordered by most recent.

## Details about development
#### On this project is used SQL Server and Entity Framework 6 for the database operations. Code first is, for me, sounds like great approach for this example, where generated SQL is not so important and we dont have too much data in databse. On first migration that you will run when download project, EF will seed database with two posts and few tags. Database will be created on default instance. In case of localdb isnt avalible, in web.config I have added and commented connection string on default instance of SQL Express (".\SQLEXPRESS"). At the end if there is no SQL Express, please edit connection string to your server locally or remote. Database will be created and data will be seed.
#### To divide database objects from JSON data, I have used view models with some data annotations for validating model state. If post that is selected by slug for delete or update, you will get custom JSON response with status and message.
#### For ident the post, in api we use the slug. Slug is generated by title on post creating, but if we try to insert post with the same title as one in the database, the system will automaticly add "-2" to the slug. 
#### Tags are case-sensitive, so Microsoft and microsoft aren't same, becouse in assignment that is not specified. Tags and posts are represents like two tables in database and connected with many to many relationship.
